unfortunately Ive an issue with keygroup layouts on the tau!
... the issue is, the keyboard does is not rectangular, it has 2 rows with 4 more keys.
this is a problem since all the calculations are based on it being rectangular.
it looks like to cope with this I would need a special 'tau' mode.

in practice this means you could probably use, if your created a keygroup, that didnt use the extra 8 keys, 
and made the tau look to be rectangular... and set the linear flag to false.
