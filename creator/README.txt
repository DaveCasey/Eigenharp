IMPORTANT NOTE:
Ive recently updated to creator 2.0, Ive updated the wiki but there may be some 'oddities'
things to look out for are:
modules have now been renamed to templates
createsetup.sh is now creator.sh


The original creator (1.0) can be found in creator/1.0, to use:
cd 1.0
bin/createsetup.sh pico conf/basicdemo.conf

However, this is now depreciated, and will be removed once 2.0 has had more user testing.


more documentation is available on the github WIKI
the basics are covered here:

a more in depth coverage of how to understand setups and 'modules' and developing your own is here:
