IMPORTANT NOTE:
Im in a transtion from creator 1.0 to 2.0
The original creator (1.0) can be found in creator/1.0
to use:
cd 1.0
bin/createsetup.sh pico conf/basicdemo.conf

if you use createsetup in creator/bin it will be 2.0 and some may variations exist

currently all documentation is for 1.0, this will be updated once 2.0 is stabalised

more documentation is available on the github WIKI
the basics are covered here:
