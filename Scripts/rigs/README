in this directory you will find a number of instrument rigs for use with EigenD, all ae based on the Tau rigs unless specified otherwise

The create scripts just create the rigs, they do NOT wire them up into a setup, as this will be different depending upon the setup they are going to be loaded into
them
the link script is very much a sample to show what is needed to be connected, basically keygroup, and mixer - its for pico mix, but basically the same for other setups

notes:
- the sample oscillator are never preloaded with samples, they are deliberatly left blank, so you will need to set using belcanto, or workbench or stage
- the audio units  are never preloaded with plugins, they are deliberatly left blank, so you will need to set using belcanto, or workbench or stage
- all rigs are default names user X rig , eg. user synth rig, so as not to clash with factory ones, you can rename see comment in rig file
- all belcanto files have .bc suffic, so that editors can determine file type

files:
createsynth.bc	-  simple synth based on sawtooth oscillator, as provided in alpha and tau setups
createaudiounit.bc - rig for housing audio unit and vst instruments
createsimplesampler.bc - rig for playing samples
createdoublesampler.bc - rig for which play 2 different samples of left and right pan, based on yaw of key
createpanpipe.bc - a panpipe rig, created by Antonio based on STK	
linksynthrig.bc - sample script, which shows how to link a newly created synth rig into pico mix
