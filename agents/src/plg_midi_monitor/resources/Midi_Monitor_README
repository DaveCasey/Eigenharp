Midi Monitor
RELEASE 0.0.1

Warning: this is a 'testing' release, things probably will change, so dont get upset if they do...
but id like to get it out there asap. (also the code needs a bit of cleaning)


Contributions
=============
Mark Harris - agent

Overview 
=========
An agent that uses lights to monitor various midi messages,
may be used for education (e.g. learning pieces), information 
or for creative uses
One of my primary purpoes for this agent is 'DAW integration and feedback, but think creatively.


most of all ENJOY !!!


Using
=========

a) connect midi monitor agent to a keygroup which you wish to use for scale and layout information.
this could be an existing 'playing' keygroup, or could be one created for this purpose alone

b) then connect it to a keygroup output, again... it could be an existing one (connected to a rig) or a new one.
connec this to  : controller input, light ouput 

c) now you need to connect a midi source, in eigenD the choices are from Midi Input agent (for external sources), Midi Converter (for internal)

d) configure midi monitor to either CC or notes mode, using the enable functions


inputs/outputs on agent:
======================
controller input - connect to keygroup, used for layout, scale, octave, tonic, base note etc.
light output - used to light the LEDs
midi input - used for midi messages

channel - 0 all channels, N = only this channel

enable notes - use musical mapping to light LEDS according to midi notes
velocity for status - velocity of notes, determines colour
channel for status - channel determines colours
(note: orange if neither of above options active)
close note - used in non chromatic, if in C maj, receives C# with light D
first note - only light the first note, not repetitions in other courses

enable polyphonic pressure - on poly pressure, change LED colour

enable control with key - individual keys (of musical mapping) are used to represent a CC, coloured according to value
enable control with course - a column (of physical layout) is used for CC


Think creatively!!!
===================
for  CC mapping, remember you create create custom keygroups, with custom musical and physical mappings...
this means you dont have to display all CCs, or layout in strict numerical order
Also for the CC as column, it knowns the length of the column, and will adjust value and colour distribution accordingly
e.g. if you create only 4 rows high, then this will be 0,31,63,127 and each coloured differently)

In particular, the easy was to get specfic lighting, is to create a custom keygroup (or more than one) off the keyboard agent,
and then add specfic mappings to it to get what you want.    (my simple demo, just had the default mapping of all keys in one course)


Recommendations
===============
you can have as many midi monitors as you wish, all connected to the same inputs if you wish.
Id recommend the modes
enable notes (+ optionally enable poly pressure)
enable poly pressure
enable control with key
enable control with course

other combinations may have side effects ;)

Too many to list at this stage :)
