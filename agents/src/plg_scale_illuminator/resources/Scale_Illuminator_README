Scale Illuminator
RELEASE 0.1

Contributions
=============
Mark Harris - agent



Overview & Install
==================
Install by double clicking package, this will install agent and also demo scripts.

you can find a demo script for each device, (alpha is for factory setup 3, but works with 1 & 2)
use commander  (or script browser to execute)
e.g
alpha scale illuminator execute

IMPORTANT NOTE: when you initially connect agent to keygroup (manually or thru above script), you
should see the tonics lit (no scale, as no reference scale has been set yet).
If you do NOT see tonic, it is because the keygroup doesnt have the scale set, it appears some factory setup
have incorrectly not set the scale (and are just defaulting to major), so set the scale explicity and you will see the
tonic light!


to change the reference scalei/tonic, you need to use the belcanto below (or use workbench)


alternatively you can do manually, just use  workbench to connect agent to keygroup output of choice
change reference scale & tonic
inverted = false, shows notes of scale in green, inverted = true, shows note not in scale in red
root = true, show root/tonic of scale in red = normal green = inverted.
e.g.
scale illuminator hey tonic to 0 set
scale illuminator hey scale to [0,2,4,5,7,9,11,12] set
scale illuminator hey inverted toggle set
scale illuminator hey root toggle set

note: you cannot yet use scale names or tonic (note) names

TO USE:
ENJOY !!!
