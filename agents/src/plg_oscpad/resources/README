ABLETON LIVE PAD 
RELEASE 0.8

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT ONLY!!!!!
it is not finished, and has a number of shortcomings its really just a demo to play with at this stage

Ive played with it on a demo of Live 9, but should work on 8 too


TO USE:
a) first install LIVE OSC , following instructions at http://livecontrol.q3f.org/ableton-liveapi/liveosc/
but essentially, copy the LiveOSC directory found with this agent to:
/Applications/Ableton\ Live\ 9.app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI\ Remote\ Scripts 

b) In ableton, setup LiveOSC as control surface in preferences

c) install into factory setup by
start EigenD, load factory setup
start commander and execute the script using the following belcanto
interpreter hey pico osc pad execute
then save the setup

OR you can manually add to your own setup
c) start EigenD, and in workbench create a new 'osc pad' agent, and connect it to the keyboard (or probably a keygroup too, but not tried that ;))


press keys on your pico (etc) to record/launch clips.
green = playing
orange = availble not playing

off = nothing there
