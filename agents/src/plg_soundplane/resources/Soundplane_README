Mark Harris - agent

Overview & Install
==================


attribute
=========
data_freq (250) - the number of times per second messages are sent to the client, the soundplane usually uses 250, note this is limited by sample rate and buffer size
e.g. for SR = 48000 BUFFER=192, max data freq= 48000/192= 250
pitch_bend (0) - use roll to induce pitch bend, this is the range in semitones, usually zero, as you use scaler to do the pitch bend
max_voices (16) - maximum number of active keys at a time, above this value the agent will steal voices, usually can be left as 16 like soundplane, and let client steal voices if appropriate
kyma (false)- enable kyma mode, send kyma mode, this is completely UNTESTED and experimental as I have no means of testings
host port (3123) - port to connect to
host name (localhost) - host to connect to

breath = /x1
abs_strip 1 = /x2
abs_strip 1 = /x3
abs_strip 1 = /x4
abs_strip 1 = /x5


CHANGE HISTORY
==============
known issues :

change log:
0.0.1 - initial release
0.0.2 - fix lexicon so eigencommander can create agent
0.0.3 - fix timing isssue with data freq
0.0.3 - implement infrequent tasks every seconds
0.0.3 - add support for kyma mode
0.0.3 - add zone support for strip and breath
0.0.4 - kyma mode now listens on port 3124 and can connect on any port


KYMA
====
This is completely untested and I have no way of testing as I dont have a kyma system, (and so perhaps apart from idle curiosity is not of use to me :))
looking at the soundplane code, I can tell the following
basically, the message is slightly different, and kyma will respond to the soundplane to tell it when its connected, and how many touches it wants.
it connects back on port 3124

in 0.0.4, i now have a listening thread on 3124, and it will display messages from kyma on in the log (but will ignore them, e.g. not setting max touches yet etc)
also you can set the port to connect to, for kyma this should be 8000, (it defaults to 3123 which is for t3d)
